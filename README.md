You can build this Dockerfile with the following command:

`docker build -t my-node-app .`

And run the container with:

`docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app`

Make sure to replace my-node-app with the name you want to give to your container.
This Makefile has a few targets:

- build: builds the Docker image
- run: runs the Docker container and mounts the current directory as a volume
- stop: stops the running container
- clean: removes the container
- install: installs npm dependencies
- start: starts the Node.js app
- test: runs the test suite

You can run any of these targets by executing make <target>. For example, to build the Docker image, run make build.
